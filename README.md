## Notes

Some basic Rest API calls were developed.
  1.	All Restaurants - List with restaurant tag and id
  2.	One Restaurant - restaurant tag and id for only one app (Hard Coded id)
  3.	Restaurant Menu - Menu for one restaurant (Hard Coded id)
  4.	Restaurant Order - Menu for one restaurant (Hard Coded id)
  5.	Menu - Menu by Id
  6.	Order - Order by Id


Create the set of REST API's that can answer the following questions:

  1.	Number Of Orders - Total number of orders for each restaurant
  2.	Total Amount - Total amount (money) of sales per restaurant
  3.	Frequent Meals - The most frequently ordered meals on FOODit Platform
  4.	Category By Restaurant - The most frequently ordered category for each restaurant

## Comments
  1.	Opted for Jersey rest points
  2.	Sorry! Saw no point of thundr framework, so removed it
  3. 	Uses mem cache - but a combination with SQL would be better
